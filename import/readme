Scripts:
-import.pl
  - used to import the documents, topics, and document-topic data into the database.  required before any edge creation can be run.

-edge.pl
  - precompute similarities
-edge_compiled.pl
  - precompute similarities, but in java so its way faster


Edge creation assumes:
-document_topic weights > .15
-document_similairity > .6 (news) > .75 (sports), .85 (business)
  -maps to top 20% for each dataset
-topic_similarity > .85
  -same for all datasets

Edge creation (boosted) assumes:
-document_topic weights > .15
-document_similarity > .7 (news), .7 (sports), .8 (business)
-topic_similarity > .8

Edge creation (boosted, normalized) assumes:
-document_topic weights > .15
-document_similarity > .7 (news), .45 (sports), .65 (business)
-topic_similarity > .7 (news), .6 (sports, business)
